# Where's My Money

A Personal 'Fintech' Application  

[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/f5be67cc1a014fcab81676691fcbd100)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/xcarol/wmm/dashboard?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Badge_grade)  

## Development environment

For Ubuntu 23.10, install:

- build-essential
- cmake
- docker
- docker-compose
- freeglut3-dev

Download and install Qt from [https://www.qt.io/download-open-source](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source)  
Install Qt at _/home/xcarol/Qt_ and check the path declared at _CMakeLists.txt_ when setting _CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH_ to be correct.

### MySql Driver for Qt

At first run of the application the following error can raise up in the console and the application cannot connect to the MySql Server.  

``` Log
QMYSQL driver not loaded
QSqlDatabase: available drivers: QMIMER QODBC QPSQL QSQLITE QMARIADB QMYSQL
```

The problem is that _Qt_ cannot find _libmysqlclient*_ library.  
To know the needed version by the driver go to _Qt_ installation directory where drivers are located (p.e. ~/Qt/6.7.0/gcc_64/plugins/sqldrivers) and run the following command: `ldd libqsqlmysql.so` look at the _libmysqlclient_ version `libmysqlclient.so.21` in this case 21. If it says `libmysqlclient.so.21 => Not found` then run: `sudo apt install libmysqlclient21`. If doesn't says `Not found` go to pray because I have no idea.

## Vs Code

Install the following extensions

- ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack
- llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd
- twxs.cmake
- ms-vscode.cmake-tools
- vadimcn.vscode-lldb

## Qt Creator

I olny used it to create de project and to edit the *.ui files with Qt Designer

## MySql Server

There is a _docker-compose.yml_ file to create a local mysql database.  
And a _mysqlserver.sh_ script to manage it.  

Acces database through [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)  

## Backup / Restore

This application relies in the _mysql_ and _mysqldump_ applications to backup and restore the database.  
Make sure _mysql_ and _mysqldump_ are installed and accessible by _$PATH_.  

## Translations

Use the _lupdate_ and _lrelease_ tools to update the language files.  
When using the vscode CMake extension, it provides an easy way to run them both from its _Project outline_ view.  

Use _linguist_ tool from the command line to translate the literals.  

## Application Guide

### Duplicates

What are duplicate transactions?

When you import new transactions, some of the first ones might already be in the database because they were the last transactions from the previous import. In this case, when searching for duplicates, you can manually delete the duplicated transactions.

Another scenario for finding duplicates is when you see two identical transactions, but they are actually different.

Since bank transactions may not include a timestamp, only the date appears in the transaction details. Imagine buying a â‚¬1 drink in the morning and the same drink at the same store for the same price in the evening. You'd see a duplicate transaction that's a false positive. In this case, you can mark them as non-duplicates. The next time you search for duplicates, they won't appear, but they will still be counted as separate transactions.
